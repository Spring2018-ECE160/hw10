# Question 4

(Eckel, 12.14, 12.15) Write a class called Bird that contains a string member and a static int. In the default constructor, use the int to
automatically generate an identifier that you build in the string, along with the name of the class (Bird #1, Bird #2, etc.). Add an operator<<for ostreams to print out the Bird objects. Write an assignment operator= and a copyconstructor. In main( ), verify that everything works correctly.

Write a class called BirdHouse that contains an object, a pointer and a reference for class Bird from Exercise 14. The constructor should take the three Birds as arguments. Add an operator<< for ostreams for BirdHouse. Disallow the assignment operator= and copy-constructor. In main( ), verify that everything works correctly. Make sure that you can chain assignments for BirdHouse objects and build expressions involving multiple operators.

Note that this is very similar to the DogHouse example we went over in class.
